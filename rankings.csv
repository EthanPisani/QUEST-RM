""Before I offer to allow your faith to establish this cathedral, you must understand how we, as a people, have arrived at this point.

We have allied with anybody who seemed to possess strength, for no other reason but to survive. Survival. That was the name of the game. If ten soldiers attacked a hundred goblins, who would win?

The mail itself went under a tunic of green with a soft leather sleeveless doublet keeping everything hidden and in place.  A belt, sash, scabbard and cloak rounded out his pile of goods.  He assembled them into a bundle at the corner of the entrance to the carriage.  The ragged remains of his last outfit he dropped to the ground before he jumped out, but as soon as he hit the ground he gathered them into a small pile.

 {'content': 'Arman wasn\'t sure what to think about channeling magic. He didn\'t think he couldn\'t do it, but he had never done it before either. He discussed wtih Carmard and Arum how they would do it, asking Harold a question or two from time to time. After a bit, everyone nodded their heads in satisfaction. If he could hold and control it, it would work.  Arman had watched Carmard build the circles and was glad of the Protective circle. If he did lose control, that might be the only thing that saves everyone else.  He stepped into the smaller circle in the center, and unrolled the parchment scroll with the spell on it. He set it on a small stand and pulled back the sleeves of his shirt a little bit. He then started the countdown, starting to gather the energies to himself. The scroll was set up a little different than he was used to, and broken up into five different sections. They seems to progress harder as he looked at it.  At the zero mark, they all started to do their seperate hand movements, except Arman, who was copying Carmard and Arum at the same time, a somewhat difficult task as the hand movemements became faster. He started saying the first paragraph, the words also matching the hand movements they were all making. At the end of that, a small burst of light struck all of them as the conduits for power were opened. The circle he stood within, was glowing fiercly.  Arman didn\'t dare blink. It was taking everything to concetrate on the scroll and combine all the hand movements. They repeated what they had just done and added the second verse. Each words were causeing the air around them to glow a white blue color, and now the power could almost be visibly seen by those outside the circle also. The second circle out from Arman is now glowing brightly.  They begin the third round and power can be seen moving from the first and second rings, to include the third ring. The room was growing bright and everyone could soon see details within it. Armans neck itched where his hair was rising, but he put it to the back of his mind.  The beginning of the fourth was harder. His arms were tried from making the hand motions and from fighting and casting spells. He wanted nothing more than to just stop. He kept going. He heard Carmard stumble a little in the words, and saw the bubble around them ripple as the ward was touched by the magic.  It would have killed them all....  Carmard picked it back up again and soon the fourth ring was glowing brightly, causeing the thick, magic filled air to make it hard to see in the circle, or for that matter, within the circle itself. Arman squinted a little to see the scroll in front of him. He could no longer see Carmard and Arum well, but knew they were there, and knew what hand motions they were making. He could feel it through the weave.  It was glorious... and deadly.  The fifth paragraph amde all the circles glow fiercly. The strain of holding so much power within himself was starting to tell. His leg was hurting very badly and he wanted to do nothing more than let go and collapse. But to do so now, would not only kill those in the room, but possibly the whole town. He had to hold the power just a little longer...  Carmard and Arum add their own spells to the spell that Arman was casting, making the power in the room increase rapidly and frightingly. Those who were used to such power, which wasn\'t many, stood and tried to deal with the uncomfortable feelings. The rest ranged anywhere from groaning to sheer howling with terror.  He began another countdown quietly and at the right time, stepped out from his circle. This was the tricky part....  His foot broke the first circle outside his and a large boom followed by the shockwave followed. He almost fell over, but held himself up. He broke the next circle with the same effect. And the one after that. Soon, the only full circles remaining, were the protective one, and the one he was standing in. He turns and heads back to that circle now, becoming fully aware of how little in protection it was offereing him.  Standing in the circle once more, he picks up the keystone in his hands, and with his right foot, breaks the circle around him again.  The force of the magic entereing him, made him scream from the shock and the pain. It was something that almost made him lose his concentration. The only thing that kept that from happening, was the thought of all the people that would be killed if he did.  The light aroud him was becoming blinding as he started to shout, then scream the final words of the spell. His nerves felt afire, and he felt warm. The keystone, surprisingly, felt cool within his hands and he held onto it, pouring the energies into that and picturing the portal. He couldn\'t think of what it looked like...  Mystra help me...    Then he knew. The picture was becoming clearer in his mind. The keystone was getting cooler. he was on fire.... His leg hurt, his hands hurt, his head hurt. He could feel everybone in his body straining to not break from the energies flowing through him. He could feel his hair whipping around his head, as the energies flowed around him in the cyclone, and into the keystone, charging it.  A large crack, loud eough to be heard by the town and possibly those outside it, pierced the room and made it shake.  Then there was nothing. His body still hurt, the nerves all super excited and unable to handle nothing when there was so much before. He looks at the stone in his hands, and grins. It was glowing. The circle was glowing too, the runes etched into the stones all glowing slightly blue. They were all together and in order.  Arman let go of the keystone with one hand and pumped his fist into the air. ""I did it!""   Then the pain really hit. it suddenly felt like a dagger had been shoved into his chest. He gasped for breath and his eyes rolled towards the back of his head. He felt the earth under him, the gritty sand digging into his burned hands.

Honestly, she really wouldn\'t have cared less, but now she would have a far more interesting game to play.  A Battle Royal between gods, the winner winning the right to become The One True God. This had the setup to be the greatest game ever, hopefully off the combatants would be just the same.

""  With that out of the way, Kaguya left the building and was on her way to a nearby airport. She had a flight to catch to Beijing, as the next major gaming tournament was going to be held there.

This would greatly confuse all of the other gods, as they couldn\'t sense any of the others. If every other god becomes horribly confused, Kaguya could easily take advantage of it and easily and systematically wipe out the rest one by one without anyone getting in her way. It was also good cover when she needed to play games, because she needs to do that. . . a lot.  Of course, Kaguya could easily see past her own Falsehoods, but could the rest?

 {'content': ' Some time later. . .   ""I was unsure if Changmu heard me. Perhaps I was too hasty in my decision to take on that girl."" Charles mused. The wizard walked up towards the steps of the museum, now being used as a safe house from the raiders and gangs that sometimes ransacked houses and other areas where people had left their homes vacant. The evacuation of the area was not total. Outside, after Charles phased himself through the museum doors, he looked out behind him. There was a squad of soldiers marching. . . obviously towards Fairfield. The entire city had gone into a panic. It was being evacuated, but some people were too afraid to leave their homes. Some were being eaten alive. The wizard shuddered at the thought of this actually happening. He turned his head, and started to walk forward, as guns started to point at his head. There appeared to be homeless people, or at least very shabbily dressed folk in the Museum\'s very spacious lounge. This place had it\'s own power supply, and running water, they could remain here for quite some time.  Charles had only one reaction to the guns pointing at his body, he motioned his hands faster than they could pull their triggers, and found their guns now floating in their air, pointing towards them. ""I am a friend. As I understand it, there are some people who can\'t just walk out and leave the city. More than a handful of you are former criminals barely starting a new life. I am an answer for your earnest heart\'s desire to turn around and live with honor.""  One of the former thugs stood up from his comfortable lounge chair and gave Charles a skeptical look. ""What the fuck? What the hell are you doing coming in here like you can talk to us like that? Your mystic juju isn\'t going to make us lick your ball sack.""    Charles gave a smug look.  ""Jason."" He nodded towards them all, naming the ten men who were in the lounge, and winking at the many others who were witnessing the scene in front of them. ""I know you all, and I don\'t need fancy electronic gadgets to spy on you to know all this."" He looked at Jason and referrenced his vulgar statement. ""I don\'t want boot lickers, I want students. Not disciples, but those who would study what I have to teach. You can deal with your problems the way normal people do, maybe with counseling, if you can find some, maybe a Church or other sort of reform, but I have not come to have you ""Lick my ball sack"".

You also all have very sharpened wits, some of you who seem dumber than any other have the most specialized focus to become renowned minds of the sciences and other important fields of study. Listen. . . please. All I want you to do is consider that I can help you."" He paused for breath and then continued. "" You have taken refuge here in this abandoned museum, for many good reasons. It\'s security systems, it\'s self-sufficiency of electric power, you all have plenty of room for storage, and heck, if you run out of ammunition for long range weapons, there are still swords and weapons of antiquity that are available for your use.""

What if I told you I could just get you all out of legal trouble without any effort at all? All of you have bounties on your head, some folks want you dead, others want you in prison, but circumstances presently dictate any prison sentence will be a death sentence, and maybe a rape and/or torture sentence on your heads anyway.

Charles blinked, and immediately, the one hundred folk using the Museum as their home for the time being found themselves in the Void. A floating area of space. They were sitting on their chairs or standing up on their feet. All of them looked around. ""What the hell?""    Charles smiled.  ""Relax. .. I can bring it all back.""

At Bel\'s question, he sighed. He stood up, and grasped Bel\'s hand in his own, helping him up. ""My mission...?"" He asked coyly, but soon pursed his lips together. It wouldn\'t be right to make Bel wait for much longer. He observed the shops around. There was a cafe, a toy store with adorable little cotton animals sewn together overseas, a book store with countless pieces of paper, and so many more. The smell of tobacco smoke, gasoline, and hot dogs polluted the air and for the first time, Harp realized they were in a huge city. As a few seagulls flew overhead, he realized they must be near the ocean. It was windy, and the winds whistled through the buildings.

But being so close to Harp at the moment was seriously messing with his natural warning system... which was already foggy because of the cupid\'s arrow.  Bel, in all honesty, did not know a great deal about cupids. He knew basic stuff, things he had heard. They were beings of love, attraction, and affection. Annnnd that was about all he knew.

She has blond hair, typically tied up by a red ribbon with dark blue eyes with dark colored skin from days spent working outdoors in the sun. She has a slim, though not unhealthy build with some fairly obvious muscles - she likes to take care of her body as best as she can. A few scars run across her back, as well as her leg and abdomen. Results from a few ill-run ins with things out in No-Man\'s land.  Typically, she wears thick leather clothes, and keeps a mask drawn up over half her face to protect both her identity and face while working. At her sides, typically rest two self made pistols, and on her belt, ammo. On her back, a modified rifle designed to take out targets at long distances.   Personality:  Lila? Living mostly by herself as made her rough, somewhat on the gruff side and definitely not well mannered. While not intentionally rude or antagonistic, she has almost no filter for what she says and can irk more than quite a few people. She doesn\'t particularly care, though. If someone gets their panties in a knot over something someone said, they might as well just go get shot. Rather cynical as well, she mostly tends to not work with others unless she\'s forced, preferring to remain mostly independent.  That said, she isn\'t particularly unfriendly either. She just prefers being by herself unless she has reason to. The only thing one should watch out for, is getting on her bad side. Once she\'s set her sights on something - barring death, nothing will stop her from trying to get it. Thankfully, there\'s not much she wants in life so this shouldn\'t be much of an issue.   History:  Many would be surprised that if they traced back Lila\'s origins, it\'d be all the way to Saiga. The small, peaceful nation of monks and philosophers who generally don\'t particularly engage in warfare. Indeed, she was born and raised there for most of the first Seventeen years of her life until she got fed up with the life and left. She had a loving mother and father, as well as a fairly funny old man for a teacher. She had it good, really. But she had always had a bit of a chip on her shoulder and a rebellious streak. Always getting into some small bit of mischief, liked going out of the city and exploring the wilds, much to her parents dismay.  While she didn\'t have any issue with the monks, their teachings, or their way of life - she was utterly bored being kept there all day and told to study. She could already manifest Ki from quite a young age, but quiet meditation and contemplation was not the way to go about making yourself better with it. Only practical applications of things, ever made one better at something. That was her philosophy and what she\'s always believed.  One day, when she was about seventeen years old, she had finally got fed up with the quiet life - and left. She learned real quick, that No-man Land wasn\'t as forgiving and fun to \'explore\' as she thought they were. In her first week, all of her supplies she had taken with her, had been either stolen or she had to drop to save her own skin from wild animals and other dangers. She was able to live long enough to make it to Arcadia, and despite the danger No Mans land presented, she couldn\'t help but to be drawn back to it after a while of resting up. This time though, she\'d be more prepared.  Pistols that she\'d eventually modify, as well as a rifle. Since then, she\'s just been exploring and living off of No-Man\'s land as best she can, making only occasional stops in any of the cities. Sometimes, only a few times a year. Also may or may not have occasionally stolen from people to help with that. Especially the CMAS or any other big organizations that ever wander into No-Man\'s land for whatever reason.   Occupation:  Diver, outlaw, and self proclaimed explorer.   - - - - (Power Matrix)   Primary Focus:  Ki  Magical Capabilities:    -While most who focus on KI go for raw strength, Lila has decided to go for a more...subtle approach. Increased Speed, Agility, Reflexes, Sight, and Hearing are her main usage of it. She\'s not going to be doing any instant transmission stuff, but she\'s an acrobat and one might find her doing ninja flips to avoid bullets and blows whilst simultaneously unleashing a few precise shots of her own.  -Fairly durable, and can take a few hits though she\'s not going to be dishing out any strong blows.  -Aside from her training with Ki, she has taken up some small form of Arcane training from a brief stint in Arcadia, specifically of the element of Electricity to use in tandem with her guns. Her Arcane Network isn\'t all that powerful and she can\'t use it that well, but she can use it enough to charge the guns to fire them. However, it tends to be a bit draining and can be used only a few times before she\'s exhausted.  -Can manifest it without the guns, but it doesn\'t have much range and it\'s not typically lethal. Used mostly to temporarily stun enemies so she can finish them off if they get to close or otherwise unable to use her guns. It can be quite devastating with a combination of martial arts if she has to use them.    Body Modifications:  None  Weapons and Equipment:  -Modified pistols, designed to both function like a regular fire arm, as well as a rail gun when supplied with electricity. Made them herself.  -Rifle, for taking out targets at long distances.  -Several different types of ammo. Explosive rounds (Basically a volatile piece of A/B. Trying to railgun these results in bad times usually), Armor Piercing rounds, and of course regular ammo.   Specialties:  -Basic knowledge of martial arts, though typically reserved for situations she doesn\'t have her guns. -Fairly good head on her shoulders, though isn\'t some big inventor. She\'s just learned to make do with what she\'s had, and has learned to jury-rig or modify existing pieces of technology well enough. -Knows how to survive for extended periods out in No-Mans land. -Not really helpful, but she doesn\'t do so well in large crowds or small spaces.

The irony of those days amused him still, for though he crafted many blades during his time on the fires, he used none.

The palace, though, was new, and in so many ways, overwhelming. The variety might remind him vaguely of Limbo and it\'s inherent chaos, but this... this was so much more. So many colors, and the Githzerai used none of them. In denying themselves so much, could their path truly be pointless? Certainly, an ordered mind was needed, but there was order here as well, and if nature itself used such wild colors, why should any race do otherwise?  The scenes in the glass, on the other hand, were vaguely disturbing. Zengral had seen such places before, when traveling, but always they reminded him of home, and how different things were there. Still, that sensation lasted only a moment, for having seen such places, having stood, perhaps, in some of the places shown in the glass, he knew that being disturbed by them was foolish.

Even if Boro had heard, she couldn\'t know for sure how he might react, and if things went badly the whole group would end up blaming her for it.  It would\'ve been easier to just stay in the background and let events run their natural course.  At least that way, whatever happened wouldn\'t have been her fault.  Then she heard Boro speak her name.  Frightened, she looked up, only to see him walking away, disappearing amidst the thick clouds of smoke that faded away soon after.   What?   It... was over?  He\'d left them be, releasing everyone from the prison formed by his Quirk without kicking any of them out.  Perhaps it was just luck, but her gamble had paid off.  Before she got a chance collect herself, Tommy had his arms around her again.  His compliment made her smile, along with the sudden realization that she\'d actually been right and that she  might  have just saved everyone from being booted off the program.  Part of her felt like pumping her fists in the air and shouting out with relief, but she kept herself restrained, not wanting to look smug about the whole affair.    ""Thanks!  To be honest, I wasn\'t quite sure if...""   She trailed off, seeing that he\'d moved on already.  A free spirit, that one.  People were tricky, impossible to fully understand though raw calculation, but at least now she\'d started to get a sense of how this strange group worked, even if a few individuals remained a mystery to her.  Lagging behind the more adventurous students, she managed to get a quick look past them to the room ahead, where Tumble herself awaited.  Her eyes widened, and she blushed a little at the sight.     Whatever she\'d been expecting, this wasn\'t it. There really was no way to put it politely: the so-called hero looked like the kind of woman who\'d hang around in dive bars and nightclubs, letting people pick her up and have their way with her. The messy hair and unkempt clothing Shuko could understand and sympathize with, but for their supposed mentor to be completely asleep, not making any effort to present herself well for them, with her blouse in a state like  that  in front of a group full of teenage boys?  What the  hell  had Tumble been thinking?  The only thing that kept Shuko from freezing up in sheer mortification was the echo of Boro\'s parting words.   Believe in Tumble.   This could be a test, or a prank, a plan meant to keep the hero candidates on their toes and gauge their reactions.  She couldn\'t back out just yet, not until she was sure.   Nor could she stand by and let the boys pile onto a sleeping woman like that.   ""Wait!""   She reached out with both arms, trying to grab Tommy before he went careening off towards the slumbering hero, but he\'d already gotten a head start and she only ended up stumbling forwards, painfully banging one hip on the table\'s edge.   ""Aaaaah-!""   It wasn\'t serious, but it made her lean over and wince, cutting short any further attempts at dealing with the rowdy boys.  Not that she could have done much anyways.  Helpless, she could only glance imploringly at the other girls, hoping one of them would be able to intervene before Tumble woke up and realized what was going on.  ', 'role': 'user'}

Boro was not gaining any affection in her eyes. The thing that removed Nori from her train of thoughts was a growl of some kind; upon looking around to find the source, she noticed Fenrir, who apparently threatened Nori; she didn’t really understand why he was so upset about it when others barely batted an eye, but appearances needed to be kept so she innocently gazed at Fenrir and softly said,    “Well…sorry, I didn’t know your ears were that sensitive, though it’s pretty obvious if you think about it-“   her last words being said in a more joking tone before removing the smile from her face and scratching her right cheek with one finger, as if to look cute.  “I *did* warn you.”     After addressing Fenrir, Nori turned around, only to see a round table with a single person sleeping on it in the most nonchalant way possible. It made Nori lift the right corner of her mouth and twitch her eye in dismay.   ""Mmmm... Woman of the hour.”   Nori quickly glanced towards the blind girl before looking back towards the sleeping beauty. The words slowly sunk in, that unruffled woman was Tumble! She is the one that gave Nori the opportunity to challenge U.A., and she is the one in charge here. The sight made Nori a bit agitated though, Tumble was a very popular hero, but this slop in front of them didn’t look competent at all. Yet she was even more agitated at the boy buttoning up her shirt as if it was the nicest thing to do. She wanted to speak up about it but before being able to, a little boy was flying across the room, looking to tackle Tumble. Her first reaction was surprise, what reason did he have to glide straight into Tumble? How did he even do it? Luckily, she was able to contain herself and remove any unnecessary thoughts so she could focus on the important things, like impressing Tumble herself.   With a sigh, Nori set one arm to face Tommy and the other in the opposite direction and she began to suck air in from Tommy’s side and pushing out air on the other end. In a flash she was racing across the room getting closer to Tommy, and with each inch closer, the pull affected Tommy more.  As he skidded across the table, aiming to fall right into Tumble’s lap, suddenly he felt the air around him drawn off course, his first instinct was to ‘pull’ harder to compensate, but if he did that he would be more likely to hurt Tumble than give a surprise. Changing from pulling to pushing, Tommy flew towards the source of the suction force, a pale girl with fun hair’s arms. Well… if she had her arms wide open, what kind of gentleman would Tommy be if he didn’t oblige~?  Opening his own arms to match Nori’s, Tommy was soon on a collision course with her instead, adjusting his speed so he didn’t slam into her, Tommy was mere moments away from impact.   “I didn’t know my hugs were in such high demand! You could have just asked, I was also going to get around to everyone at some point~.”   Nori’s plan had completely backfired, both literally and metaphorically. That little brat was heading straight for him, and it all went so fast that she could barely hear what Tommy was saying. she tried to stop and dodge him, but the momentum didn’t allow her to move, and so with a squeal, the two hit each other and tumbled down on the floor.    BGM   Nori blinked a few times, still a bit surprised; at least the fall didn’t hurt a whole lot since she used her quirk to reduce the fall damage. upon looking down, her eyes fell upon Tommy who blissfully had his arms wrapped around her. Yet instead of red cheeks and an awkward expression, Nori looked pissed off.   “Get off of me boy, what is wrong with you!”   She shouted while pushing Tommy aside with a good gust. after getting up, adjusting her clothes and hair and facing Tommy she continued with an almost scolding tone,  “You can’t just fly across the room  hugging  everyone as you see fit, it’s rude, annoying, and obnoxious. have you ever seen a hero fly around cuddling everyone? It’s childish, even for someone of your age, so stop it; if you want affection, earn it.”   Nori’s arms were folded at this point, her gaze still on Tommy.  Nori’s gust lifting him into the air Tommy, suspended himself for a moment to flip backwards for dramatic effect. Landing with arms up in the air and then looking around with a wide grin on his face like he was an olympic gymnast that had just completed their routine. He was about to take a bow when Nori berated him. Her points had merit and the affection comment did cut close to the bone, but he couldn’t just let her have the last word!   “Well, ma’am, you did a spectacular  job  of  blowing  me away, but why shouldn’t a hero fly around hugging people? Disasters happen, villains happen, just plain old scary stuff happens. Hugs are comforting, reassuring. They say ‘I’m here, you’re safe’. Hugs and affection? They might as well be as important as a hero’s costume. Is it childish? Probably. So is dressing up in spandex and stopping a mugger. So is coming up with a whacky code name to be called by everyone while wearing the spandex. A hug is important. Even a quirkless can be ‘super’ if they can give a kid a hug when needed, sometimes people need that more than a costume.”  Bowing after making his point, Tommy’s smile was as ever present as always, but lacked a certain charm. Getting back up, the charm was back on and sighed.   “And here I thought I could be the first thing Miss Tumble saw upon waking, oh well. I’ll make a hugger out of you ma’am~!”    “Is that your excuse for hugging everyone around you? You’re obviously missing the point, it’s really sweet that you want to comfort people, it’s a heroic quality even, but let me ask you; when you came at Tumble or me, did we look like we needed comfort? what if I felt very anxious around people, what if I didn’t like being hugged out of comfort at all? You’re not paying attention to others around you before you assault them, so that begs me to think, you have ulterior motives for your charade. besides, if you go around hugging people at the pace you’re at, it will give as much comfort as a handshake.”    “Charade?!”  both hands over his heart, Tommy acted as the the accusation struck him physically  “My word, you wound me! Well, if I did have an ulterior motive it would be something along the lines of ‘I like hugging and I’m a human being and therefore inherently selfish by nature’. But that’s on the assumption that I have an ulterior motive. Besides, have you given Miss Akemi a hug? It’s so soft! As for you, you’re wound kinda tight. If you were anxious around others would you have yelled at Marl back there, challenging him to a duel? If you don’t like being hugged, well I’d find out pretty quick and adjust my actions. Like what has happened now. My actions, my responsibility. It wouldn’t be Miss Shuko’s fault if I hugged you and you didn’t like it. It wouldn’t be Miss Tumble’s fault either. Mine, that’s all. Point is though, are we going to debate the fact I hug people all day? Or are we going to do something productive?”   Nori being as competitive as she is, got lost in trying to win the debate, and it took Tommy’s final words to make her realise it. she had made a fool of herself by talking about such a silly and childish subject with such passion, and that did make her blush. quickly facing away from Tommy and towards Tumble, she hoped that her future teacher was still asleep and hadn’t heard all the commotion.    “Fine, let’s leave it at that then.”   She said abruptly before walking away from Tommy and towards a chair to the right of Tumble, sitting down with her arms folded.   “A wise general does know when to retreat… or something like that anyway~”  going back over to Shuko, Tommy saw she’d hurt herself and offered her a seat. Nori’s talk making him think he was somehow responsible, and also offering one to Akemi, because that was just good manners.   ', 'role': 'assistant'}]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
